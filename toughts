If you have enough data, you can try Early Stopping method: divide data in three data sets,
 training, validation and evaluation.
 Train each network along a sufficient number of epochs to see the training Mean Squared Error to be stuck in a minimum.
  The training process uses training data-set and must be executed epoch by epoch,
   in order to calculate the Mean Squared Error of the network in each epoch for the validation set.
    The network for the epoch with the minimum validation MSE is selected for the evaluation process.
This approach can be applied also with regularization methods and k-fold cross

Image Augmentation is having a large effect on the accuracy
Same because the image is 28x28 which is small
